### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software professional with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering and over 15 years of experience in software development, implementation consulting, and solution architecture. Throughout my career, I have worked with a variety of programming languages, including C/C++, Java, Ruby, PL/SQL, and GO, and have utilized Oracle databases extensively. I have a deep understanding of payment systems and computer architecture, which has allowed me to develop efficient and effective solutions for my clients. In my spare time, I enjoy playing chess and working with Raspberry PI, which has further developed my technical skills. With over two decades of experience using Linux, I am a proficient and dedicated developer who is always eager to learn and improve. 
In addition to my passion for computer science and technology, I also have a keen interest in aeronautics, mechanical engineering and physics.
Apart from my interests in technology and science, I also have a deep passion for music. I play the drums and guitar and learning the saxophone and piano.
I speak Italian fluently and am proficient in English. Currently, I am working on perfecting my Greek, which is a fascinating language. Being multilingual has allowed me to communicate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures, and I believe it has broadened my perspective and enriched my life experiences.
